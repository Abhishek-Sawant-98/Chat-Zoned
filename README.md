# `Chat-Zoned` MERN-Chat-App

- This is a _**Chat Web App**_ built using `MERN Stack` ([MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and [`socket.io`](https://socket.io/) for real-time messaging. Just started building this. Frontend is also being developed using [`Material UI`](https://mui.com/), and [`Bootstrap5`](https://getbootstrap.com/). Many more features are yet to be added.
